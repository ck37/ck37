### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am an instructor in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital / Harvard Medical School, with a [PhD in biostatistics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/biostatistics/biostatistics-phd/) from UC Berkeley. I work in Jordan Smoller's [Center for Precision Psychiatry](https://www.massgeneral.org/psychiatry/research/center-for-precision-psychiatry).

- ðŸŒ± Projects from my postdoc include:

   1. Measuring consumption of opiods following surgery, and reducing overprescribing through prescription guidelines and provider interventions.
   2. Deep learning for surgical videos and operative notes to evaluate surgical skill and risk of complications.
   3. Measuring COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients using item response theory + EHRs.

- âœ¨ My three dissertation projects are:

   4. [Constructing interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning, applied to hate speech](https://hatespeech.berkeley.edu)
   5. [A new targeted learning method for causal inference of multiple treatments (mixtures), applied to chemical exposures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1of5I8eLh-zhMSuyrHjSI8JA3jHA6GFGqmm1EVfrqCaI/edit)
   6. [A nested ensemble clinical model for heart attack risk prediction in electronic health records](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jL7ukjJ95T-J0XbCOd2O-eMr4EGpqF5AzP2VxFoYRMA/edit)
- âš¡ Additional long-term projects include:

   7. Multi-modal deep learning to track social media marketing of e-cigarettes (vaping) to teenagers - [initial study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2019.00075/full)
   8. Causally motivated, nonparametric variable importance - [varimpact software](https://github.com/ck37/varimpact)
