### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am finishing my PhD in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley and moving to Boston in August. I will begin a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School's [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) in September. I also provide data science consulting services from time to time.

- ðŸŒ± My three dissertation projects are:

   1. [Constructing interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning, applied to hate speech](https://hatespeech.berkeley.edu)
   2. [A new targeted learning method for causal inference of multiple treatments (mixtures), applied to chemical exposures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1of5I8eLh-zhMSuyrHjSI8JA3jHA6GFGqmm1EVfrqCaI/edit)
   3. [A nested ensemble clinical model for heart attack risk prediction in electronic health records](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jL7ukjJ95T-J0XbCOd2O-eMr4EGpqF5AzP2VxFoYRMA/edit)
- ðŸŒ± Additional long-term projects include:

   4. Multi-modal deep learning to track social media marketing of e-cigarettes (vaping) to teenagers - [pilot study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2019.00075/full)
   5. Causally motivated, nonparametric variable importance - [varimpact software](https://github.com/ck37/varimpact)
