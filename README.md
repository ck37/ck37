### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently finishing my PhD in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, and moving to Boston this August. Iâ€™m **seeking a Boston-area/remote postdoc in biomedical deep learning & causal inference**, or similar research scientist position. Prior to my PhD I worked in Washington, DC where I conducted dozens of RCTs to improve voter registration and turnout of underrepresented populations, ran digital marketing \& voter contact programs, and supported action on climate change.

- ðŸŒ± My three dissertation projects are:

   1. [Constructing interval latent variables via Rasch measurement and multitask, ordinal deep learning, applied to hate speech](https://hatespeech.berkeley.edu)
   2. [A new targeted learning method for causal inference of multiple treatment variables, applied to carcinogenic chemical exposures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1of5I8eLh-zhMSuyrHjSI8JA3jHA6GFGqmm1EVfrqCaI/edit)
   3. [A nested ensemble clinical prediction model, for heart attack risk prediction in electronic health records](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jL7ukjJ95T-J0XbCOd2O-eMr4EGpqF5AzP2VxFoYRMA/edit)
- ðŸŒ± Additional long-term projects include:

   4. Multi-modal deep learning to track social media marketing of vaping to teenagers - [pilot study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2019.00075/full)
   5. Causally motivated, nonparametric variable importance - [varimpact software](https://github.com/ck37/varimpact)
