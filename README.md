### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing my PhD in Biostatistics at UC Berkeley, and moving to Boston this August.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a Boston-area or remote postdoc focused on biomedical deep learning and causal inference, or similar research scientist position.
- ðŸŒ± My three dissertation projects are:

   1. Constructing interval latent variables via Rasch measurement and multitask, ordinal deep learning, applied to hate speech
   2. A new targeted learning method for causal inference of multiple treatment variables, applied to carcinogenic chemical exposures
   3. A nested ensemble clinical prediction model, for heart attack risk prediction in electronic health records
- ðŸŒ± Additional long-term projects include:

   4. Deep learning to track social media marketing of vaping to teenagers
   5. Causally motivated, nonparametric variable importance - varimpact software
