### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am a postdoctoral fellow in [biomedical informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School, with a PhD in biostatistics from UC Berkeley.

- ðŸŒ± My main postdoc projects are:

   1. Measuring overprescription of opiods following surgery, and reducing overprescribing through prescription guidelines and provider interventions.
   2. Analyze surgical videos and operative notes with deep learning to evaluate surgical skill and risk of complications.
- ðŸŒ± My three dissertation projects are:

   3. [Constructing interval variables via faceted Rasch measurement and multitask deep learning, applied to hate speech](https://hatespeech.berkeley.edu)
   4. [A new targeted learning method for causal inference of multiple treatments (mixtures), applied to chemical exposures](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1of5I8eLh-zhMSuyrHjSI8JA3jHA6GFGqmm1EVfrqCaI/edit)
   5. [A nested ensemble clinical model for heart attack risk prediction in electronic health records](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jL7ukjJ95T-J0XbCOd2O-eMr4EGpqF5AzP2VxFoYRMA/edit)
- ðŸŒ± Additional long-term projects include:

   6. Multi-modal deep learning to track social media marketing of e-cigarettes (vaping) to teenagers - [pilot study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2019.00075/full)
   7. Causally motivated, nonparametric variable importance - [varimpact software](https://github.com/ck37/varimpact)
